## What I've tried this time

- @@ meet a bug: `Identifier 'modal' has already been declared` -- caused by importing `<script>` 2 times
- Practice: advanced DOM, new events (load, scroll)
- Used `IntersectionObserver` + `.getBoundingClientRect` to create appear behavior + sticky bar
- Used "DOM traversing" to make event detect more specific elements
- Made use of "DOM propagation" to prevent add lots of unneccessary `eventHandler = 1*[event]*[amount boss require us]`
- Some design components:
  - Lazy loading (low quality img + blur effect)
  - Accordion components (toggle `opacity`)
  - Slider (make use `transform:translate`)
